""" Matrix - Tetris
You are given a following process.

There is a platform with n columns. 1Ã—1 squares are appearing one after another
in some columns on this platform. If there are no squares in the column, a
square will occupy the bottom row. Otherwise, a square will appear at the top
of the highest square of this column.

When all the n columns have at least one square in them, the bottom row is
being removed. You will receive 1 point for this, and all the squares left
will fall down one row.

Your task is to calculate the amount of points you will receive.
